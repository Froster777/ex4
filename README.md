The top secret clearance allows an individual access to information or material classified as top secret [Exchanger24](https://exchanger24.org). The granting of a top secret clearance requires a favorable adjudicative determination made by the appropriate authorized adjudicative agency, as well as a favorable completion of all required special background investigations.

In 2012, the federal government granted security clearances to about 3.5 million people. In the past, clearances had to be renewed every few years but now the government is reviewing them every five years for many people.

A security clearance is an individualâ€™s status to have access to classified information and restricted areas after completion of a background check. Security clearance levels appear in job postings for many Department of Defense (DoD) jobs, and other positions involving substantial responsibility. Employers prefer to hire people who already have clearances at the level needed for a given position, as security clearances may take up to 12 months to process.

In the interim, security clearance levels often appear in employment postings for private security positions, or other jobs involving substantial responsibility, such as air traffic control or nuclear energy positions. Security clearances can be issued by government agencies such as the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of State. The Department of Defense issues most of all clearances.
